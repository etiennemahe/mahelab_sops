# emergency
- See SDS

# cleanup
- Wipe down work surfaces with 70% isopropanol
- NOTE: Do not use isopropanol on instruments

# waste
- Tips/Tubes should be disposed of in yellow biohazard bag/tub

# maintenance
- See Qubit 4.0 Manual above for

# before_starting
- Identify the specimens requiring Qubit assay quantification and obtain sufficient Qubit tubes 
- NOTE: ONLY Qubit tubes can be used with the Qubit instrument
- NOTE: ONLY label Qubit tubes on the top cap

# procedures

5.	Vortex each tube x 5 seconds; incubate the tubes at room temperature x 2 minutes

6.	Tap to wake the QUBIT; select the appropriate specimen and assay type

7.	If the WS is fresh, read the new standards

8.	Read each query specimen one at a time, ensuring that specimen volume is set accordingly (ie at 5 uL); record the concentrations (in ng/uL)

9.	Update the specimen database with the concentrations

10.	Any leftover WS should be stored in the 4C fridge
